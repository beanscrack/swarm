# swarm

A Rust workspace for orchestrating swarms of LLM agents: scheduling tasks, tracking budgets and usage, and persisting runs, events, findings, and artifacts.

> Status: early development. The CLI entry point is currently a stub.

## Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `swarm-core` | Shared types: ids, agents, tasks, runs, events, messages, budgets, config, provider/tool traits |
| `swarm-store` | SQLite persistence (sqlx) with migrations for runs, tasks, agents, events, artifacts, findings, hypotheses, usage |
| `swarm-providers` | LLM provider abstraction, OpenAI client, mock provider, pricing, quota, registry |
| `swarm-scheduler` | Task scheduling |
| `swarm-tools` | Tool implementations available to agents |
| `swarm-runtime` | Agent runtime tying scheduler, providers, tools, and store together |
| `swarm-cli` | Command-line interface |

## Building

Requires Rust 1.94+ (edition 2024).

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

Local state (`.swarm/`, `*.db`) and build output (`target/`) are git-ignored.
